# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?
- Create a usable and appealing website for our client
- We will each do our part and work equally on the project
- We will respond to feedback from the client and ensure that the client's goals are met


2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
- Check everyone's work 1-2 days prior to milestone deadlines
- Meet weekly to dedicate time to work on the project


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
- Meet in person weekly
- Text if you need help
- Check in before milestones


4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
- Phone calls and email to client
- Single point-of-contact, information is disseminated among all group members


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
- Each member will directly contribute to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Two members will complete 2 HTML pages and provide finishing touches on CSS and JavaScript
- Two other members will complete 1 HTML page and code CSS layout, responsive design, and most of interactivity


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
- Check to make sure assignments are done by sending texts and communicating when parts are finished
- Ask if the member is confused, needs help, has special circumstances; offer help or kindly ask them to complete their responsibilities
- Talk to the member and see what blocked them last time, how we as a team can help contribute and move the project forward


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
- Talk it about; discuss what's wrong and make sure all members agree with the solution
- Discussion and diplomacy > insults and illogic arguments


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
- Only revisit if necessary when group runs into conflict
- Majority has to want to revisit the contract


9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
- Take breaks, get coffee/boba after milestones


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
